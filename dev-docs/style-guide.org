#+TITLE: Style guide for Ubermag

* Introduction

Based on discussions during the summer 2022 workshop, and updated during winter
2022 workshop.

* British versus American spelling

- We use British spelling in documentation and source code.

- Exception: there are situations where we pass on arguments to ~matplotlib~,
  ~holoviews~ and other packages. For this to work and where these use American
  spelling, we have to use American spelling, too (such as ~color~ for example).

* Ubermag

The spelling of the Ubermag project is "Ubermag", with a capital "U".

Where we refer to the Python package ~ubermag~, we use the spelling that is
technically correct (i.e. all letters lowercase) and use a monospace font to
express this in documentation. The same applies to the conda package ~ubermag~.
